### 1. Fork and Make changes in Others Repo 

If we want to make changes someone else repo, then
First fork the repo using github webpage (Click on Fork button).

Clone it using Https/SSH into your machine.

#Example

`git clone https://github.com/TheSRCode/Github-Examples_SR.git`

Edit or make changes as per requirments.

ten run these cmds to commit and push code into the main branch

```  sh 
git add .
git commit -m "Comment"
git push origin
```

### 2. Using Git in VS code

Instead of using codespace, I am using VS COde in my local.
